# Jay's Top Modules
This project extends the [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) by adding modules from the popular "Top modules" blog series on [Mediacurrent.com](Mediacurrent.com). Most of the instructions from that project [readme](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) apply here as well.

This project is meant as an educational tool that will save you time getting setup.

# Installing
The easiest way to get started is to clone this repo and run `composer install`. This will download Drupal core, recommended "Top modules" and their dependencies. Once that is done you can install Drupal as normal but now you will have additional contributed modules you can install.
