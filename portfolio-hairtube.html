					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
					<p>One of my favorite hobbies is watching YouTube videos from the <a href="http://www.naturalhairmag.com/going-natural-really-mean/">Natural Hair Community</a>. This fun project involved designing a responsive layout, writing semantic HTML, and obtaining a Google API key. Also added links to the YouTube channel. The most difficult task was setting the request page tokens when the Next and Previous buttons are clicked.</p>
