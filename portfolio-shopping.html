					<h2>Shopping List App</h2>
					<span class="block-label">The Challenge</span>
					<p>Design and code a web app that allows users to enter items they need to purchase, check and uncheck items on the list and permanently remove items. This <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> project improves knowledge of CSS positioning and jQuery basics. </p>
					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
					<p>Wireframed the design using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. I loved the idea of building a list against a chalkboard image. But keeping the background static as the list grew proved to be a challenge. Once the JS functionality and basic CSS styles were in place, I used two different background images for a responsive experience. Also added a counter for remaining items and a sliding instruction area. Font is <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/eraser">Eraser</a> by David Rakowski.</p>
