					<h2>Alexis Jordan Official</h2>
					<span class="block-label">The Challenge</span>
					<p>Build site for Roc Nation artist Alexis Jordan. This was the first theme I ever developed for Sony Music.</p>			
					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>		
					<p>Given a hip and colorful design, developed site including language switcher and social share capabilities.</p>
					<p>It's been a while, and the content for the Hungarian version was better maintained than the English. Who knew they were such fans?</p>
