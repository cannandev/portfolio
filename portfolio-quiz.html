					<h2>NYC Quiz App</h2>
					<span class="block-label">The Challenge</span>
					<p>Another <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> project designed to explore Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript. Design and code an interactive quiz app from scratch.</p>
					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
					<p>Designed and built a Q&amp;A quiz all about NYC. This was a great exercise in understanding objects, arrays and MVC. This project was definitely the 'aha moment' understanding objects in JavaScript. Each object includes a question, a possible answer and a cool fact.</p>
					<p>The progress bar simulates an NYC subway map, where each correct answer brings the user a stop closer to their destination. This was also a fun way to use pure CSS and JS for animation.</p>
