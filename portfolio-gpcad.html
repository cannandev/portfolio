				<p>Redesign the GPC Admissions homepage. Build a modern, responsive, HTML5 theme on an existing Drupal 6 multisite platform.</p>
				<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
				<p>The number of existing responsive themes for Drupal 6 were few and cumbersome! So we decided to build a custom theme from scratch. The homepage (really three pages - Start, Explore, Apply) features a Drupal administered contact form, scheduled jumbotrons and a Google Map powered by the Views module.</p>
				<p>Paid particular attention to removing extraneous markup from the PHP template files for lighter fields, nodes and views.</p>
