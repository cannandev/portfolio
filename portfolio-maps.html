					<h2>Thinkful Tourism - API Mashup</h2>
					<span class="block-label">The Challenge</span>
					<p>Final <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> assignment to bring together HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX in a single project using the API(s) of our choice. Response data required in the JSONP format.</p>
					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
					<p>Designed and built a mock tourism site. <strong>Thinkful Tourism</strong> features a mashup of the Google Maps API and the Instagram API, allowing users to view information about a remote location before booking a trip.</p>
					<p><a href="https://instagram.com/googlemaps/">@googlemaps</a> has a lovely Instagram page. These photos and their locations provided the source data for the "tourist spots". Used AJAX to request JSONP data on each photo and plot their locations as Google Map markers.</p>
					<p>Displaying the details of each "tourist spot" required an intuitive UI and several rounds of user feedback from the <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> community and mentors. Built a lightbox for the final design.</p>
