					<h2>Thinkful Tourism - API Mashup</h2>
					<span class="block-label">The Challenge</span>
					<p>As a <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> student, our last assignment was to bring together HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX in a single project using the API(s) of our choice. Response data required in the JSONP format.</p>
					<span class="block-label">The Work</span>
					<p>Designed and built a mock tourism site. <strong>Thinkful Tourism</strong> features a mashup of the Google Maps API and the Instagram API, allowing users to view information about a remote location before booking a trip. Besides building the map and pulling JSONP data on each photo, I relied on several iterations of user feedback to build a solid UI. The final solution involved building a lightbox to display location details.</p>
